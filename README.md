# Turtle Race Game

This is a simple turtle race game using Python's turtle module. In this game, 6 turtles of different colors will race towards the finish line, and the user can place a bet on the turtle they think will win.


## Prerequisites

 Python 3.x
 
turtle module


## How to run the game

Clone the repository or download the code as a zip file.

Navigate to the directory where the code is saved.

Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt: python turtle_race.py
## Rules

The user will be prompted to select a turtle they think will win the race.

The turtles will race from the left side of the screen to the right side.

The first turtle to reach the right side of the screen will be declared the winner.

If the user's selected turtle wins, they will be notified that they have won. If their selected turtle loses, they will be notified that they have lost.
## Additional Information
The colors and starting positions of the turtles are randomly generated every time the game is played.

The distance each turtle moves forward each time is also randomly generated.
